# Autonomous Delivery Agent

This project is about designing a simple autonomous delivery agent that navigates a 2D grid city to deliver packages.
The agent must avoid obstacles, handle different terrain costs, and even replan if something blocks its path.

>>Features

-> Environment:

    Grid-based map.

    Obstacles (-1 = wall).

    Terrain cost (1 = normal road, 2+ = slower road).

-> Algorithms Implemented:

  1. BFS â†’ Basic uninformed search (all roads same cost).

  2. Uniform Cost Search (UCS) â†’ Like Dijkstra, considers road costs.

  3. A* â†’ Best balance (road cost + heuristic).

  4. ill Climbing â†’ Local search (not always optimal, but fun to test).

  5. Dynamic replanning â†’ If a new obstacle appears, agent replans the path.

-> Agent Movement:

    Moves up, down, left, right (4-connected).

ðŸ›  Requirements

Python 3.x

No extra libraries needed (only heapq, random, time, all built-in).

â–¶ How to Run

1. Open Google Colab or your terminal.

2. Copy the code from main.py (or notebook cell).

3. Run it, and see the output :
BFS path: [(0,0), (0,1), ... , (3,5)]
UCS path: [(0,0), (1,0), ... , (3,5)]
A* path:  [(0,0), (0,1), ... , (3,5)]
Hill Climbing path: [(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), ...]
--- Dynamic replanning ---
Initial path: [...]
New obstacle appeared at: (2,3)
Replanned path: [...]
 
ðŸ—º Test Maps

We can edit the city variables to test different maps.

Small Map
city = [
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, -1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
]
Medium Map
city = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1],
    [1, -1, 2, 1, -1, 1],
    [1,  1, 2, 1,  1, 1],
    [1,  1, 1, 1, -1, 1]
]

Large Map
city = [
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    [1,-1,-1,1,2,2,1,-1,1,1],
    [1,1,1,1,1,-1,1,1,1,1],
    [1,2,2,2,1,-1,1,2,2,1],
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
]

Dynamic Map {for replanning}
city = [
    [1,1,1,1],
    [1,1,-1,1],
    [1,1,1,1],
    [1,1,1,1]
]

ðŸ“Š Experimental Notes

- BFS is fast but ignores road costs.

- UCS finds cheaper routes but can expand many nodes.

- A* is usually the most efficient (best path with fewer expansions).

- Hill Climbing sometimes gets stuck (not reliable but shows local search).

- Dynamic replanning works with A* (if new obstacle shows up, it recalculates).

ðŸŽ¥ Demo

You can run the dynamic_demo() function to see how the agent replans when an obstacle suddenly appears.

Example output is printed in the console.

ðŸ“š Author Notes

This project is made for learning AI search algorithms in a fun way using a delivery agent.
Code is kept simple and in a readable form, more like an student project than an industrial one.
